  <h1>Design a City Scale Intervention in Response To Your Data</h1>
  <ul>
<li>Explain why you have chosen the site you have, with evidence
<li>Who uses the precinct, when and why? Consider groups or individuals, scheduled use versus occasional use.
<li>What is the precincts relationship with the broader urban context? What are the adjacent spaces and/or buildings and what are their functions and who are their users?
<li>What are the precinct’s material features? i.e. hard and soft landscaping
<li>What are the precinct’s formal features? i.e. is it bounded by buildings, fences, a street.
<li>What are the precinct’s environmental features? i.e. is it shaded, exposed to the sun, exposed to high winds etc
<li>How could people use this precinct in better ways?
<li>In what ways could the site be improved to promote more or varied use?
<li>In what ways could digital placemaking initiatives address the problems or opportunities identified?
<li>Drawing on the analysis and reflecting on the role(s) ‘smart’ technologies can play in addressing the issues/opportunities identified identify minimum x4 precedent examples of urban interaction design projects (existing or speculative) and outline their relevance and applicability to your public realm site.

<li>Diagram the key issues and design responses you have made to them. These diagrams should explain your design too.
<li>Present your design on mapbox and with renders and words.
